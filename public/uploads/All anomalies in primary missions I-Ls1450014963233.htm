			<td valign="top">Summary:
- There was a time sync issue between the BCR and ACE, caused by the ACE. The anomaly was resolved by executing an ACE processor reboot. Spacecraft bus and payload currently nominal. (BCR - Battery Charge Regulator; ACE - Attitude Control Electronics)
- This anomaly posed no threat to the long-term health of the spacecraft. The impact to science is that the ISOC team must use a more labor-intensive data processing technique to de-spin the affected data. 
- The entire anomaly recovery process occurred below 15Re, where the payload does not collect data.
- This anomaly is thought to be a result of radiation. While not common, it has been observed in other MicroStar missions. Since the anomaly ocurred near apogee it was most likely due to a GCR.
Description:
- There was a time sync issue between the BCR and ACE, caused by the ACE. 
- This was diagnosed because there were an increasing number of HMLogs (Health and maintenance logs) put out by the ACE &amp; BCR. The HMLogs come out any time there is an anomaly, be it a small timing error or a major anomaly. Each HMLog has a characteristic message describing what the anomaly is; these messages can be read upon dumping the Flight Computer buffer.
- As a precaution we deleted the commands for the re-pointing maneuver at perigee and the payload transition to high voltage. A new ATS with these commands was prepared, to be uploaded after successful recovery from the anomaly. (ATS - Absolute Time Sequence commands stored onboard in the Flight Computer and executed autonomously at the designated time) 
- The Flight Computer buffer was dumped and telemetry showed the HMLogs were of the 'small timing error' sort. ACS, Systems and Software engineers conferred and agreed the most likely problem was that the ACE &amp; BCR got out of sync due to radiation and the problem was on the ACE side. (ACS - Attitude Control System)
- At the 6/18 FRB it was decided to reboot the ACE and see if it fixed the timing issue. We dumped the SSR and then did an ACE reboot. 
- Immediately upon reboot it was apparent the problem had been corrected because no HMLogs were being generated. Please note: If the ACE reboot alone had not worked a BCR reboot would be executed, but that was not necessary. Neither of these reboots affect the power to the payload, or effect the payload's operation below 15Re (where the anomaly recovery activities were performed).
- The reboot telemetry was monitored long enough for the spin reading to stabilize and to verify that no additional HMLogs were generated. An ATS was uploaded to execute the re-pointing maneuver before the 1700 pass and turn the payload on at 15Re (per standard payload operations). The spacecraft performance was verified on the 1700 pass before the payload entered HVSCI at 21:30.
- The spacecraft bus and payload are behaving nominally according to real-time SOH data collected at the 6/22 apogee contact.
Please see attached Orbital RAZOR Issue and powerpoint for details.</td>

- At the 6/18 FRB it was decided to reboot the ACE and see if it fixed the timing issue. We dumped the SSR and then did an ACE reboot. 
- Immediately upon reboot it was apparent the problem had been corrected because no HMLogs were being generated. Please note: If the ACE reboot alone had not worked a BCR reboot would be executed, but that was not necessary. Neither of these reboots affect the power to the payload, or effect the payload's operation below 15Re (where the anomaly recovery activities were performed).
- The reboot telemetry was monitored long enough for the spin reading to stabilize and to verify that no additional HMLogs were generated. An ATS was uploaded to execute the re-pointing maneuver before the 1700 pass and turn the payload on at 15Re (per standard payload operations). The spacecraft performance was verified on the 1700 pass before the payload entered HVSCI at 21:30.

- There was a time sync issue between the BCR and ACE, caused by the ACE. The anomaly was resolved by executing an ACE processor reboot. Spacecraft bus and payload currently nominal. (BCR - Battery Charge Regulator; ACE - Attitude Control Electronics)
- This anomaly posed no threat to the long-term health of the spacecraft. The impact to science is that the ISOC team must use a more labor-intensive data processing technique to de-spin the affected data. 
- The entire anomaly recovery process occurred below 15Re, where the payload does not collect data.
- This anomaly is thought to be a result of radiation. While not common, it has been observed in other MicroStar missions. Since the anomaly ocurred near apogee it was most likely due to a GCR.

Onboard FD&amp;C removed power to the payload, rebooted the Flight Computer and put the spacecraft in it's safest state, Contingency State. The spacecraft and payload health was as expected after a reboot. One orbit of data (one swath of the sky) was lost due to SSR data corruption. This swath has already been imaged once in BBBBB nominal operations, so the net effect is a reduction in statistics in that swath of the sky. </td>

The 9:35pm EDT blind acquisition pass went well. Upon contact with the spacecraft, all systems were within limits with values expected in Contingency State. After command link was verified we uploaded a Transmitter OFF command. After verifying spacecraft SOH in Contingency State the Contingency Recovery procedure was started. The procedure ran smoothly and configured the spacecraft in Housekeeping State with all telemetry nominal.
The CEU was then powered on. All payload housekeeping was nominal. The SSR read &amp; write pointers both read 0, indicating that the SSR was not in self refresh mode (see explanation at end of email). Because of this the data on the recorder is likely to be corrupted. The SSR blocks were dumped as planned in 3 stages: 1) data surrounding the time of the anomaly, 2) data for the entire orbit, 3) data since the CEU power-on. All of these dumps were executed successfully.
The spacecraft is in Housekeeping State and the payload is in LVENG mode. All systems are functioning nominally.

The inertial precession maneuver was successful.
During tonight's first pass telemetry was nominal. ATSs for the 0700-0800 contact and the inertial precession maneuver were uploaded. The maneuver occurred during the 0700 pass. The burn itself could not be monitored due to ground contact problems, but once telemetry was restored the successful completion of the maneuver was verified.
8/12/09
We successfully completed payload recovery. All payload and spacecraft bus systems are nominal and the payload is collecting data. The night's activities went very smoothly. 
During the first pass commands for the second pass were uploaded, BBBBB-Lo then -Hi were turned on and telemetry was verified. We entered LVSCI mode and verified the spin pulse was received and equivalent to the spin pulse the ACS system thought it was sending out. BBBBB-Lo high voltage was enabled then -Hi's HV was enabled.
During the second pass both sensors entered HVSTANDBY levels and BBBBB-Lo was ramped to HVSCI levels. We entered HVSCI and dwelled between passes.
The third pass was a blind acquisition. After uploading a transmitter off command for the end of the pass BBBBB-Hi was ramped to HVSCI levels and the payload entered HVSCI. Both sensors are collecting data &amp; count rates look good.
